Projects
=====

The following are a few examples of projects I have worked on in my free
time.

Shaftoe is a simple web service to encrypt messages using public keys using

The Code Book Companion
-----------------------
Simon Singh's *The Code Book* is an excellent introduction to cryptology.
As I read it I decided to implement some of the various algorithms and

include the The Vigenere Cipher, a Frequency Analysis tool and Diffie-Hellman
key exchange implemented in Javascript.

Restorethefourth.net
--------------------
Restore the Fourth is a grassroots, non-partisan, non-violent movement
that seeks to organize and assemble nationwide protests on July 4th, 2013.
Protesters in over 100 cities across America will gather to demand that
the government of the United States of America adhere to its constitutionally
dictated limits and respect the Fourth Amendment.
