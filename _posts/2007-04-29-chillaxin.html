Well I havent Checked in for a while, but I thought I&apos;d post a quick update on my life. Patricia and I are still travelling together, we did end up getting free accomodation at Cacktus Jacks in return for 2 hours of work a day (it always ended up just being about 1) so that was sweet. That was 4 days ago. Now we are taking a small vacation on vacation to the Coromandel, which some of you miay remember as being the first place I went to after leaving the big city and the first place I rode my bike. Its really nice, we are taking everything slow, enjoying eachothers company while thinking of what to do next. Theres just so many possibilities!<photo 1><photo 2><photo 3><photo 4><photo 5><photo 6><photo 7><photo 8><photo 10><photo 12><photo 13><photo 14><photo 9><photo 11>
