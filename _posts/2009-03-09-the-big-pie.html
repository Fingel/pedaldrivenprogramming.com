In "King Henry VI, Part II,"
 Shakespeare has Dick Butcher suggest to
 his fellow antiestablishment
 rabblerousers, "The first thing we do,
 let's kill all the lawyers." That
 action may be extreme but a similar
 sentiment was expressed by Thomas K.
 Connellan, president of The Management
 Group, Inc. Speaking to business
 executives in Chicago and quoted in
 Automotive News, Connellan attributed a
 measure of America's falling
 productivity to an excess of attorneys
 and accountants, and a dearth of
 production experts. Lawyers and
 accountants "do not make the economic
 pie any bigger; they only figure out
 how the pie gets divided. Neither
 profession provides any added value to
 product." According to Connellan, the
 highly productive Japanese society has
 10 lawyers and 30 accountants per
 100,000 population. The U.S. has 200
 lawyers and 700 accountants. This
 suggests that "the U.S. proportion of
 piebakers and piedividers is way out
 of whack." Could Dick Butcher have been
 an efficiency expert?  Motor Trend,
