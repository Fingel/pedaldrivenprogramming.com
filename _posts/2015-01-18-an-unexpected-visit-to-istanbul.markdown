Here I am in Istanbul (not Constantinople) the city on the Bosporus, the ribbon
of land separating Europe from Asia and the Black sea from the Sea of Marmara
and thus the Agean to the East. As my plane glided downward and spiraled towards the glittering
city I thought about the Golden Fleece and if it had seen a similar view on it's journey from Greece to
Turkey 3 thousand years ago.

I had hoped to connect to my flight to Thessalonika immediately, but Turkey wanted me to stay.
Late flight, missed connection, security, visas, immigration (twice) and eventually a cramped ride
in an airport shuttle to some hotel somewhere in Istanbul, an unsettling 45 minutes from the airport.

So here I am typing this out at 01:00, too nervous to sleep (for fear of missing another flight) but with
nothing else really to do.

Travel has gotten faster in the modern age, but I wonder if it hasn't lost some of it's humanity.
Dysentery sucks, but if the travelers of a few hundred years ago looked upon the conditions
of airline travelers today, the lines, the turnstiles and the cramped conditions they might
just liken us to cattle.

Hopefully I will see Greece tomorrow.
