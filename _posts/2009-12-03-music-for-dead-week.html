Dead week is upon us. That terrible time when months of procrastination finally catch up to you. For all of you typing 10 page essays the day before they are due, this is for you. Hopefully these tunes can help you out a bit.

Cool track from this band out of Manchester,Â  to get that intro paragraph done.

Here is a very dreamy, relaxing song from The Animal Collective. I love the intro.

What cramming session would be complete without some Thievery Corporation?
