I recently began to foray into programming for Android. Being already experienced with Java and the general ecosystem of Java enterprise development, I feel right at home.

My first creation is called How Gnar? and the premise is simple: start the app at the beginning of your ride and receive a "gnarness" rating at the end of your ride with accompanying images and audio.

It's kinda like Strava, but really useless and dumb.

Anyways, if you want to check it out, download it here: <a href="http://toxiccode.com/misc/HowGnar-debug-unaligned.apk">http://toxiccode.com/misc/HowGnar-debug-unaligned.apk</a>

All the source is available on Github:<a href="https://github.com/AustinRiba/howgnar"> https://github.com/AustinRiba/howgnar</a>

Enjoy.
