If the me in this picture met the me of the last 2 years he would have kicked my ass immediately.

[caption id="attachment_825" align="alignleft" width="348"]<a href="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/pedaldp/uploads/2013/07/meold.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-825 " alt="meold" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/pedaldp/uploads/2013/07/meold-1024x768.jpg" width="348" height="261" /></a> Touring New Zealand, unequipped, by bicycle.[/caption]
<p style="text-align: left;">See, if the me of that picture had known that I would soon have a profession that allowed me to work from anywhere, any time with nothing but a laptop he would be wondering what the hell I'm doing. Why are you still hanging around in the Bay Area?</p>
