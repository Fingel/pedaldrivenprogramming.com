<div>Well, I like Rotorua so much that I'm going to make it my temorary home for at least a few weeks, most likely even more, despite the horrid stench.<br />As you all know, I love to mountain bike. Well the rides here are world class. In fact, the world cup was held here a few years ago. I went for a ride yesterday with some people from a bike shop and I fell in love. I can't explain how good the trails are here. Did I mention no pedestrains or horses are allowed? Its a cyclist's dream!<br />So, I've gotten a job. Starting Monday Morning I'll be stripping and refurbishing furniture (yes, some antiques, too) for $10 an hour under the table. That should last me 2-3 weeks and then after that the manager of the bike store said he might have a job for me over the summer. If I get that job, I'll be here for a while, for sure.<br />So expect the updates to come less frequently, I'm going to be busy riding. But do keep in touch! I miss you guys!<br />Stay warm!<br />-Austin</div><div class="photo photo_none"><div class="photo_img"><a href="http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=5953&op=1&amp;view=all&subj=2221068909&amp;aid=-1&id=506902978"><img style="width: 394px;" onload="adjustImage(this)" class="img_ready" src="http://photos-953.ak.facebook.com/ip002/v45/210/102/506902978/n506902978_5953_4992.jpg" /></a></div><div class="caption">Dan and Marty.
