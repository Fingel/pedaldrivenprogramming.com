Haven't had much computer tome since school got out a few weeks ago, but today I thought I'd stop by and see what was new on the interwebs.

Not much.

But I did come across a few new songs for the New Years Eve mayhem. Hope everyone is enjoying the holidays!

Everybody loves the pixies.

This is a fun track - a mashup of the 25 most popular songs of 2009 (according to Billboard) in one song. Kinda makes you realize that a lot of these pop songs sound exactly the same...<br>
