This website's server is located on what appears to be <a href="http://geotool.servehttp.com/?ip=72.32.92.64&amp;host=www.fingel.com" target="_self">a dirt lot in San Francisco's south of Market Neighborhood</a> according to <a title="geotool" href="http://geotool.servehttp.com/" target="_self">Geotool</a>. I always knew Laughing Squid had secret undreground headquarters.
