After much ado, the latest map from GraniteMaps is now available. This map covers 2 distinct areas; The first is Soquel Demonstration Forest, well known in the mountain biking community as having miles of challenging, technical singletrack. The other is the Forest of Nisene Marks which shares a ridge with Demo and provides trail users of all types some of the most pristine redwood forest trails available in California.

This new map is much improved over the [last version for Santa Cruz](http://granitemaps.com/#wilder) by having a brand new base layer. This is a custom topographic map I designed myself (detailed in [this post](http://pedaldrivenprogramming.com/2015/01/creating-nice-looking-topo-maps-for-use-in--granitemaps/)) which combines OpenStreetMap and SRTM data to create a concise, easy to read map. I hope you enjoy it.

Thanks everyone for your kind words and support! The reception I received for the Santa Cruz map was fantastic, far exceeding anything I could have imagined while creating it!
