It's amazing how little I could care about baseball. I don't know the rules, or the players names. What the hell does RBI stand for, anyway? I definitely never made it past t ball as a kid (you mean the other team pitches at you? F that! ) but now that the Giants are in the world series its hard not to get caught in the action. Bars are fun during these games. I guess I'm more of a fan of the fans than the game itself.

Speaking of non fans:

Who's down for some celebratory champagne? We know Jillian is. Sleep well sf and keep rolling!
