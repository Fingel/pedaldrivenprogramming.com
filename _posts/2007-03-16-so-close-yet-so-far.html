So for the second time in a week, I am holed up in a backpacker because of bad weather! Now I am at lake Tekapo, if I could ride every day from tomorrow on, I would arrive in Queenstown in exactly a week. Somehow I don&apos;t think thats going to happen!
Of course I cant complain, life is still great and this lake is amazing! Its got a turquoise blue color that Ive never seen before. There is snow everywhere surrounding me, Im so glad to be out of the plains! No more straight, flat roads with nothing to see but sheep and nothing to do but pedal and count fence posts! This is the promised land!<photo 1><photo 2><photo 3><photo 4><photo 6><photo 7><photo 8><photo 5>
