To the woman who cleaned my teeth.
Dear Ms Chen,
I know I havent been to the dentist in nearly a year. I know I was late for my last appointment and made a big fuss out of it. I know that I didnt make much of an effort to brush my teeth this morning, and I know maybe I deserved a little punishment. But for gods sake, did you have to rip chunks of flesh off my gums like that?
Listen, well all know dentists choose thier profession because they have a certain... sadistic streak. No matter what they say, challenge, job stability, carreer options, we all know the truth. You like to inflict pain on people. Its a known fact, so at least most dentists make an effort to make it seem like they aren't hurting you on purpose. You made no such effort. The second you pulled out your shiney metal pick of doom (why is this going in my mouth torture device) I knew I was into serious trouble. Usually, dentists try and scrape the plack off the teeth. I dont remember you even touching my teeth, just jabbing and scraping at my poor tender gums. I do remember, you calmly informing me that maybe I should floss more often, for my gums are bleeding a bit. No shit lady! What the hell do you expect them to do when you poke at them with metal spikes and knives? Of course they're going to bleed! And the way you were ravaging them, I could feel the blood trickling down my througt. Not to mention the chunks of red tissue that I both watched travel down the sucky tube and dot your medical gloves. Jesus Christ lady! You belong in a teenage horror fick, not a dentist office.
I could tell when you were finally finished that you were satisfied. Your body language was tell all. Your facial muscles relaxed into a cool smile, your shoulders moved back slightly and your legs lossened up. I thought I even heard a slight sigh. I bet you were even hoping that I was going to cry. I bet you really would have gotten off on that one. Well I would like you to know you will get no more pleasure out of me. On Wednesday I start classes and Souther Oregon University, hundreds of miles away. I'll be damned if Im gunna make a 5 hour drive just to subject myself to that kind of torture again. Fuck you. Im getting a new dentist, and I hope you and your teeth rot in hell.
