Well now that I have control of my fingers enough to type again I figure I&apos;d tell you about this weekend, and the Blues Brews and BBQ festival. This is kiwi drinking culture at its best!
I will spare you the details, although I could tell you more if you want to know, but Im sure nobody wants to know. Although I will tell you I have a bloody hand, a severly bruised hip and 2 girls that now look at me funny whenever I see them. 
The drinking started at 2 in the afternoon, and didnt stop until 2 that night. 
It was really fun. 
Later all. <photo 1>
