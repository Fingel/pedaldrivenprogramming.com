I was wandering around on the internet, and decided it would be fun to try and get a really old version of AOL running on my new Vista laptop. Well I never got one of those old version to work, but I did manage install one and all the wav files that came along with it. The one that brings back so many memories, GOTMAIL.WAV, well I had to keep that one. I now use it as my new mail notification sounds in Mozilla Thunderbird. Brings me joy every time I get a new piece of mail. Thanks AOL!
