Just wanted to post a little promotion for a site I just finished: <a href="http://www.toxiccode.com">www.toxiccode.com</a>

Its a website where you can post scripts, dotfiles, config files, or anything else linux. Other people can comment and rate your stuff. Very cool for us people who love the hand crafted linux enviroment. Check it out! Its text based browser friendly as well!
