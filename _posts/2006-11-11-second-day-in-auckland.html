Well this would be my second day here in the wonderful city of Auckland, I plan for today to go a little better than yesterday. I spent most of my time Saturday walking around the city looking for a bike shop that had moved, and when I finally did find it, was closed. In a way it was good though, I am pretty familiar with downtown Auckland already, and I'm starting to get used to the cars driving on the wrong side of the road. I'ved talked to some fun people already, all from everywhere but New Zealand. The hostel is neat, huge, and there are tons of people here. Very hip and young. 2 people in my dorm room are sick :(<br />Im not sure what I'm going to do today yet but Im sure it will be great.<br />See ya.<br />Austin.
