As if we didn't have enough reasons to make fun of the French, they have to come out with this:

To prepare for the Olympic Torch protesters, the French government has outfitted their cops with Rollerblades in order to... make them look tough.

Bad boys bad boys.

Oooh, aren't they intimidating?

Wouldn't want to mess with those... they even have brakes.

Sick moves.

The head of the division says that the Rollerblades "Aid in chasing down criminals on foot."

I'm so glad I don't live in France. But I wouldn't mind protesting there.
