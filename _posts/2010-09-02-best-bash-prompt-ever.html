Ever wish your command line was a little more friendly? Maybe you'd like to add some emotion to your static computing environment? I give you the smiley face bash prompt!

This bash prompt displays a green smiley face or a red frowny face depending on the return status of the last command executed. To use it, insert the following code to the end of your ~/.bashrc file:

PS1="\[\e[01;32m\]\u@\h \[\e[01;34m\]\W \`if [ \$? = 0 ]; then echo -e '\[\e[01;32m\]:)'; else echo -e '\[\e[01;31m\]:('; fi\` \[\e[01;34m\]$\[\e[00m\]"

Happy (or sad) computing!
