<a title="LinuxCult.org" href="http://www.linuxcult.org" target="_self">LinuxCult.org</a> is a new linux forum some of my friends have been working on lately. Its still in the infant stages, but I really encourage any linux users to stop by and check it out. Its going to be great.

<p style="text-align: left;">The board is going to have many great features. One of the cool things already housed there are the helper scripts - written by myself - that attempt to solve several common problems people have with linux. The first one has already been written. If you have problems with Linux, Ubuntu and Flash not working or not having sound, you should give this a try:</p>
