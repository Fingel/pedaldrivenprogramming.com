Thanks to my wonderul parents, I'm now the proud owner of a new GoPro. And thanks
to theives in San Francisco, I'm also the proud owner of a new [Ibis Mojo HDR](http://www.ibiscycles.com/bikes/mojo_hdr650b/)
which took the place of my lost Santa Cruz Blur LT.

I finally got the chance to use both over the weekend on a very dry, very warm,
January day:

I really enjoyed the process of both filming and editing the video. Stay tuned
for more.
