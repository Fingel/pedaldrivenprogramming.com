I've been trapped in the terrible place known as finals week for too long, finally I've been let go. This quarter is behind me, for better or for worse. Just wanted to share a song real quick that I thought was really good, Let Me Go by Phantogram.

I'll really be going - as fast as I can - in 3 days. First XC race of the season up in Echo, Or. I'm going to need to find some faster music by then. Hello spring break!
