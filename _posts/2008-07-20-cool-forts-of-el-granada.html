El Granada, California always had the best mix of suburban housing mixed in with empty lots and huge groves of Eucalyptus trees. This created a great enviroment for kids to built tree houses, fortsÂ  and neighborhood jumps. The town is much more devleloped now, so most of the places I remember from my youth have become new houses. Other tree forts and jumps have been destroyed purposedly in this new age of liability. However, a few of these old masterpieces survive, and a couple are still built and manage to stay alive for a while before being torn down by scared property owners and uptight dog walkers. Here are two I viseted today:
