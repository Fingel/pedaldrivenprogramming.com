Sao Paulo, Brazil - Isabella Nardone died on March 29th after she appeared to have fallen down into the garden outside of her father's apartment. The police suspect that that the girl, five years old, was pushed out the window of her dad's flat on the sixth floor. Some witnesses claim to have <a href="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/pedaldp/uploads/2008/04/isabella.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-71" title="isabella" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/pedaldp/uploads/2008/04/isabella.jpg" alt="isballa nardone" width="182" height="137" /></a>heard shouts from the girl saying "Stop dad! Stop!" The lead investigators believe that she was murdered by her father, Alexander Nardone, and her stepmother Ana Carolina Jatoba.  Alexander's ex wife said that the man had made death threats against the girl following their divorce and were supposed to stay separate at all times. Specific evidence against the father has been found on the scene, but investigators are still at work. Public outrage has been following the case, with Brazilians calling for the two adults to be put in jail. Still no conviction has been made.
