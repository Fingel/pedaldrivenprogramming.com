I've finally found my bum-ass a place to live! Fairfax, CA in beautiful Marin County. Im going to give you all some good reasons to visit:

1. Fog, what fog?

2. My street turns to dirt in 1/4 of a mile from my house with several trailheads.

3. We have a hottub.

4. Good mountain biking trails.

5. Good people

6. Close to S.F

&nbsp;

Great place, hardly as many yuppies as the rest of Marin co.  I'm pretty exciting to finally have  a place to rest my head, get some momentum, and become established. See ya out there!
