Hey guys just wanted to put more pictures up. I've been working really hard and saving a lot of money but its not easy. Just a few more weeks and I should have enough mula to keep going. The people here are really fun and I've met some people I will never forget. Can't wait to tell you about them when I get back, because the story is far from finished.Anyhoo, heres some pictures from work. Subsitute the vines for flowers and it looks just like the fields in HMB!<br /><img src="http://photos-996.ak.facebook.com/ip002/v61/210/102/506902978/n506902978_14996_1672.jpg"><br />Smoko break!<br /><img src="http://photos-997.ak.facebook.com/ip002/v61/210/102/506902978/n506902978_14997_8861.jpg"><br />Wire lifting in the sun.<br /><img src="http://photos-998.ak.facebook.com/ip002/v61/210/102/506902978/n506902978_14998_9565.jpg"><br />Trying to catch some shade during the lunch break.<br /><img src="http://photos-000.ak.facebook.com/ip002/v61/210/102/506902978/n506902978_15000_4088.jpg"><br />Finally!

Girls know best.
