Over the last week I've been getting a ridiculous amount of spam in my Gmail inbox. The account itself has always got a lot of spam, but the Gmail spam filters always got all of it. It was rare to get a real spam in my inbox more than once a month.

Now, I'm getting anywhere between 3 and 8 per day. Im not sure whats going on. Did Gmail change its filter in someway? Am I just unlucky? Or are the spammers getting better? In any case, I have to find a way to make it stop.
