Just when you thought the suburbs were safe, a b26 bomber has to crash land in your front yard.

Amazingly, the plane didn't hit a single house, not even so much as a telephone pole. Unfortunately, both pilots died. This photograph was the Pulitzer Prize winner for best photography in 1956.

Hanging by a thread, literally.

I would forgive the guy if he crapped his pants.
