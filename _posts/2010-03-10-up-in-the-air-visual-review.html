So seeing as though I am still recovering from illness, I decided to watch a movie to pass some time. I didn't put too much thought into it, I juts went for what seemed to be most popular on the tubes at the moment. So, it had to be Up in the Air. It's a movie about a guy who's job it is to travel the country and fire people who's bosses don't have the guts to do it themselves. Good premise right? And indeed, the movie starts of great.

Instead of write a long, boring text review of a movie, I though I'd make it a graphic. So here you go, but be warned, its a total spoiler.
