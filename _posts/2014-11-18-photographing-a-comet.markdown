{% s3_image comet.jpg, Comet %}

This is Comet Jacques. There are many [photos of it online](http://cs.astronomy.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/telligent-evolution-components-attachments/13-63-00-00-00-48-98-17/c2014-E2-Jacques_5F00_042214.jpg), but this one is mine.

This photo was taken on September 23rd, 2014 when the comet was about 1AU from earth, using a SBIG ST2000XCM color CCD camera mounted on a 12" Meade LX200.

It was a little late to be photographing this comet, but I couldn't resist the opportunity to caputre it. And with all the excitement about the Rosetta mission recently, I thought it would be a great time to fix up the image. So here it is.
