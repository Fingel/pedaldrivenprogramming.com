Wow, what a great week on<a href="http://hypem.com"> hypem.com</a>. I haven't been checking in there a lot lately but I did a few days ago and some of the new stuff really blew my mind. Sure, there were the usual hip hop/electronic mashups and Passion Pit wannabe bands, but every once and a while you pick up on a gem.

Like this one from Pretty Lights. I love Pink Floyd, and I like remixes, which probably explains why I'm so into this song:
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/pedaldp/uploads/2011/02/pretty-lights.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-468 aligncenter" title="pretty-lights" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/pedaldp/uploads/2011/02/pretty-lights.jpg" alt="" width="384" height="384" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://austinriba.com/music/PinkFloydTimeRemix.mp3">Pink Floyd Time Remix - Pretty Lights</a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">You can download a ton of this guy's music off his <a href="http://www.prettylightsmusic.com/">eye popping website</a>. Seriously, who designed that thing? I want to be their friend.</p>
