I did a lot of exploring today! This time i walked far away from the reach of most tourists, so I got some genuine local New Zealand experience. I visited a nice grassy park, where people were playing rugby and skating in a skate park. After that I went to a market, that was full of hilarious novelty items. My favorite was this guy selling ties with all kinds of crude drawings on them - from humping pigs to erict penii and vodka bottles. There were some cool smoke shops and clothing stores too. I did some more wandering and then came back to downtown. The neighboring bar is having free punch, sausages and a tequila shot at 45min, so I'll go check that out. Here some pictures I took today.<br /><br />Can you spot the 2 things I like in this picture? You'd thin I died and went to heaven!<br /><br /><p><img style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 320px; CURSOR: hand; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://photos-803.ak.facebook.com/ip002/v49/210/102/506902978/n506902978_3803_2801.jpg" border="0" /> the Sky Tower.<br /><a href="http://photos-800.ak.facebook.com/ip002/v49/210/102/506902978/n506902978_3800_6586.jpg"><img style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 320px; CURSOR: hand; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://photos-800.ak.facebook.com/ip002/v49/210/102/506902978/n506902978_3800_6586.jpg" border="0" /></a> "Learn to Spray"</p><p><img style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 320px; CURSOR: hand; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://photos-801.ak.facebook.com/ip002/v49/210/102/506902978/n506902978_3801_1200.jpg" border="0" /><br /></p>
