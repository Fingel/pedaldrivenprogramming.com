Poop bags. They are a great idea. I applaud those who brave the warm squishy feelingÂ  in order to make the trail better for everyone. I'm happy not to have to watch every step as I take my evening stroll on Ashland's wonderfil TI ditch trail. There is trouble in paradise however, it seems some have begun to abuse the use of the crap bag.

Lately I've been noticing a huge increase of brightly colored, bulbus, sagging double knotted bags of joy littering the side of the trail. Whats up with this? Like I said, gret if you pick up your dogs excretion, but why not finish the job? Its like washing the dishes but not putting them away. What gives?

Please throw away your used bags. By leaving them on the side of the trail you are not doing a good thing. You are doing a worse thing. Thank you.
