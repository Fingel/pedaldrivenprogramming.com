<a href="http://awesome.naquadah.org/">Awesome window manager</a> is great, if you haven't tried it yet. Unfortunately, the version in the official ubuntu repos is the ancient 2.x version, even in Jaunty. You can find a deb easy enough for version 3.2, but you will run into dependency hell. So, I've packaged here awesome wm version 3.2, along with most other dependencies you will need to get it installed. If anything is missing, it can be found in the official ubuntu repos. Enjoy!
