Google earth has taken an image from Nasa and <a href="http://mw1.google.com/mw-earth-vectordb/cafires/ca_fires_06_2008/CaliforniaWildfires2008.kmz">put it into google earth format</a> so you can view it inside the application. This image pretty much describes why the sky has been orange for the last month or so.

Here is a great page from Nasa that has a compilation of photos of the 2007 fires from space:
