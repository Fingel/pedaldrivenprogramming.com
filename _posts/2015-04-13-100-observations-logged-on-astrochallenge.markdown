I created [AstroChallenge](http://astrochallenge.com) to scratch my own itch: to have a place to keep an observation journal for astronomy and to share it with the rest of the community. In that I believe I've succeeded, check out [my profile and journal.](http://astrochallenge.com/accounts/profile/Austin/)

Since then the word has gotten out and other astronomers have been logging their own observations. Now, only 2 weeks after making AstroChallenge public, over 100 observations have been logged! I want to thank everyone who has helped me make AstroChallenge awesome by providing great feedback and ideas.

It's been a fun project so far and I look forward to seeing where it goes from here. Most of all, I wish everyone clear skies! Keep looking up.
