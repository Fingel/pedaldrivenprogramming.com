Could it really be true? Is there a sequel to the totally kick ass 80's BMX movie RAD in the making? I know there are lots of us out there that would hope so. I can remember my friend Jesse and I must have spent at least $100 renting RAD repeatedly from El Granada Booze and Video.

RAD is basically impossibe to find in rentals or stores these days, and as far as I know there has never been an official release on DVD. So for those of you that were somehow unfortuneate enough to not see the movie a decade ago, you will have to find a copy on the internet.

But back to talk about the sequel, according to <a title="Rad Myspace Page" href="http://www.myspace.com/theradmovie">this myspace page</a>, put together by members of the cast of RAD, they are working on making it happen. But they need our support! Please give the page a visit and add them to your friends.
