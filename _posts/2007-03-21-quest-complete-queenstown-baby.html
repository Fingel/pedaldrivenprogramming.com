5 months and 1700km (1056 miles) later, I&apos;ve finally arrived in Queenstown! How can I describe my excitement...
Arms flailing, lots of yelling, laughing, crying, jumping up and down, leg cramps, cant believe it, am I really here? 
In the last 3 days I rode over 250km because I was so anxious to finally get here. And now that I&apos;ve arrived, I cant say I&apos;ve ever felt better. This place is gorgeous, full of tourists and a mind blowing amount of activities to empty your wallet. I&apos;m staying with Fletch and Stacey, 2 friends I worked with on the river last year. I also met up with a buddy, Josh, who I met my first day in New Zealand but havent seen since. Blast from the past, mang!
So yea, my biking days are over, for now. Can&apos;t say I&apos;m very dissapointed! Its about time really, but sheeet, did I ride one hellavu distance. Now everything is going to be cruzy, just work, and travel by car. I&apos;m going to feel spoiled!
For those of you curious when I&apos;m coming back, its looking like the beggining of may. Thats when the rafting season starts back home and I&apos;d like to get an early start and make some good american cash!
And for you Lord of the Rings fans, here in queenstown a lot of filming was done. I&apos;ve uploaded some pictures of Mordor and Rohan that I took today while on a 5 hour hike. I felt like I was in middle earth the whole time!<photo 1><photo 2><photo 4><photo 5><photo 7><photo 9><photo 11><photo 13><photo 15><photo 17><photo 19><photo 21><photo 23><photo 25><photo 27><photo 3><photo 28>
