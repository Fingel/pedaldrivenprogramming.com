On Wednesday Dr. Elliot's geology 103 class went for a field trip. The main focus was on gathering fossil specimens from various locations. The fossils were all found in the Hornbrook formation, contained within Osberger Gulch Sandstone. The rocks were formed during the Cretaceous, which gives them and the fossils an age of approximately 95,000,000 years.

The interpretation is that the sediments were deposited from a beach or shallow marine environment. The abundance of the shells and the broken state of them suggests a high energy environment, so waves must have been present. By far the most common fossils (and original hard parts) were clams and mussels, but gastropods were also present. One lucky student even found a shrimp.

A nice collection taken inches away from a fault that dampened and softened the surrounding sandstone making it easier to collect

One of the many local scorpions we found. We didn't kill it in hopes that it would die in a depositional environment somewhere and make a nice fossil.
