Sunday, Dec 31, 2006<br />I can tell you what its like to be in 2007 before the date even changes! You see I am skilled in the art of time travel, and I have skipped some time to witness the new year a day early.<br />So what is it like?<br />There is a massive global hanover passing over the earth as the sun rises! You guys need to watch out! In a matter of hours it will be upon you! Invenest in Aspirin just for 1 day and you will be a rich man. I have already suffered the consequences of a night of terrorizing the local kiwi folk at the new years celebration.<br />Computers aren'tgoing to crash like they did in 2000 but there will be mass confusion as people who don't put a dash through their sevens write the date and the people that do dash their sevens read it as 2001. Idiots.<br />The year has "007" in it which makes it infinetly cooler than any other year except maybe 2666. I hereby declare 2007 James Bond appreciation year.<br />People who think 7 is a lucky number and are expecting good luck for an entire year are going to finally realize 7 is not a lucky number. It just doesn't work that way.<br />Have a happy new years all!
