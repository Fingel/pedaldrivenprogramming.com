I met Amalia at the Thessaloniki Pythess (Python) meetup (at which I gave
[one awkward english presentationn](https://github.com/Fingel/pythess-ionic)) which had
migrated to the lounge under the Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki. I thought it looked pretty cool,
so I decided I would go the next day. I propositioned the group to see if anyone else was interested
in joining me, Amalia was the only one brave enough to to say so.

We spent a few good hours at the museum and various other historical points of interest around the city.
While walking down some buzzing, narrow street Amalia told me a great story
about how it is that Greeks came to find themselves in Greece:

> After God had created the earth, he told the people that he would be at his office the next day from 7am
> to 5pm and that they should come by so He could assign a place for them to live.
> The next morning God came to his office to unlock the door and found the English already waiting for him.

> God said to the English: "Since you are so early, I am giving you the best pick of land. It is a large
> island and you can do with it what you please."

> After God made the final arrangements he escorted the English out of his office and there He found the Germans,
> right on time.

> To the Germans He said: "Since you are first in line, I am giving you a large piece of land. There you will
> have plenty of space for your industry and farming."

> And so God spent the rest of the day allocating land to the people of the earth. At last 5pm rolled around,
> and as God was locking his office door the Gypsies arrived.

> To God they pleaded: "Please God, give us some land. You won't believe what happened on the way here.
> The bus was late, Mother was sick, and there were all sorts of complications. Please, have pity on us."

> God replied to Gypsies: "I have given away all the land. I am sorry you are late but there
> is nothing I can do for you. From now on you will be the children of the earth. You will not
> have a land to call home but you will be of the world."

> Satisfied with this answer the Gypsies left God in peace. As God began his walk home, he was
> approached by the Greeks:

> "God, wait! We are here for our land! We are sorry we are late but it's not our fault!"

> God, annoyed, replied: "I am sorry, I have given away all the land, there is none left for you."

> The Greeks would have none of it:

> "But please! All these things kept us from being on time. We wanted to come earlier, but we were hungry,
> so we had to stop to get something to eat. And then one of the sheep got away so we had to bring it back,
> not to mention all the traffic!"

> God, now getting angry, replied: "I am sorry. But you are late and there is nothing I can do for you. You will have no land."

> The Greeks continued, loudly, franticly gesturing with their hands: "But PLEASE! We have these pains, it keeps us from getting
> up early in the morning. Oh! And this weather! We could barely walk in this wind, how were we supposed to get here on time?
> Not to mention we wanted to do the laundry, so we could have clean clothes and--"

> "Fine!" God exclaimed, exasperated. "There is one piece of land left, it is the best land in all the world and I was
> saving it for myself. But I will give it to you if you just SHUT UP!"

> And so the Greeks were given the land of Greece.
