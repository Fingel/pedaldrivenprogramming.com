There are a few last things I wanted to get to work with my laptop, mainly the webcam and microphone. I would go into detail on how I got them to work with Ubuntu but I found this great page : <a href="http://www.linux-profiles.com/laptop-computer/laptop/40#view-1">To install Ubuntu-7.04 on Dell Inspiron 1520 </a>Which is for the 1520, but should work for 1720 as well. Good luck everyone.
