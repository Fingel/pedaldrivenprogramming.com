About
=====
I'm Austin Riba. This website is a collection of my thoughts, discoveries and projects.

The first entry on this blog dates back to November 2006. The site has changed a lot since then and so has it's author. I've gone on to graduate high school and college. I've worked as a raft guide, a winery vine wrangler and a software engineer. I've travelled the globe and raced my bike.

I like computers and programming. The idea that in this age we can create something beautiful using not much more than our minds - then share these creations instantly with the word is a concept that has fascinated and inspired me since the day I laid hands on my first keyboard.

I'm not all tech. Cycling (especially the variant performed off-road) is one of my biggest passions and is guaranteed to provide me a feeling of absolute freedom every time my feet touch the pedals. I spend a great deal of time in nature, try to live a simple life light on material possessions and tend to relocate more often than is reasonable.

Through my experiences and knowledge I hope to contribute something beneficial to a society where creativity, exploration and freedom of expression are valued over material wealth, sterilized career paths and censorship. This website is my attempt at documenting that pursuit.
